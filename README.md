Making Admins Depressed mod (MADmod)
===

NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE, FUTURE UPDATES WILL BREAK
======

Designed as an alternative to Mercury which has not recieved public updates in quite some time. The goal is to provide a "simple", "easily", "lightweight" extendable tool for sandbox servers.

MADmod will eventually include an extension/tool to convert existing Mercury deployments

Use SUI Scoreboard
- https://github.com/ZionDevelopers/sui-scoreboard/
- Current support requires manually modifing SUI scoreboard until I make a Pull Request (TBD)

Setup
======

1. Download the repository -> https://github.com/MaykrIW/MADmod
2. Drop into your Server addons folder
3. Start / Restart your Server

Getting started
